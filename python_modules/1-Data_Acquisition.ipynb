Officials cited a study that suggests long term it may be possible to find 17,000 more kidneys and 11,000 other organs from deceased donors for transplant every year.\\n\\nFederal health officials have made clear for months that they intend to shake up a system that today favors expensive, time-consuming dialysis in large centers over easier-to-tolerate at-home care or transplants that help patients live longer.\\n\\n“For 50 years, we have had basically a stagnant system of how we treat people with chronic kidney disease,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II said in a briefing held Wednesday morning.\\n\\n“Right now every financial incentive is toward dialysis and not toward transplantation and long-term survivorship,” Azar, whose father experienced traditional and at-home dialysis before getting a living donor transplant, told a Senate hearing in March. “And you get what you pay for.”\\n\\nAbout 30 million American adults have chronic kidney disease, costing Medicare a staggering $113 billion.\\n\\nCareful treatment — including control of diabetes and high blood pressure, the two main culprits — can help prevent further kidney deterioration. But more than 700,000 people have end-stage renal disease, meaning their kidneys have failed, and require either a transplant or dialysis to survive. Only about a third received specialized kidney care before they got so sick.\\n\\nMore than 94,000 of the 113,000 people on the national organ waiting list need a kidney. Last year, there were 21,167 kidney transplants. A fraction — 6,442 — were from living donors, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which oversees the nation’s transplant system.\\n\\n“The longer you’re on dialysis, the outcomes are worse,” said Dr. Amit Tevar, a transplant surgeon at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, who praised the Trump administration initiatives being announced Wednesday.\\n\\nToo often, transplant centers don’t see a kidney patient until they’ve been on dialysis for years, he said. And while any transplant is preferable, one from a living donor is best because those organs “work better, longer and faster,” Tevar said.\\n\\nAmong the initiatives that take effect first:\\n\\n—Medicare payment changes that would provide a financial incentive for doctors and clinics to help kidney patients stave off end-stage disease by about six months.\\n\\n—A bonus to kidney specialists who help prepare patients for early transplant, with steps that can begin even before they need dialysis.\\n\\n—Additional Medicare changes so that dialysis providers can earn as much by helping patients get dialysis at home as in the large centers that predominate today. Patients typically must spend hours three or four times a week hooked to machines that filter waste out of their blood.\\n\\nHome options include portable blood-cleansing machines, or what’s called peritoneal dialysis that works through an abdominal tube, usually while patients are sleeping.\\n\\nToday, about 14% of patients in kidney failure get at-home dialysis or an early transplant. By 2025, the goal is to have 80% of people with newly diagnosed kidney failure getting one of those options, officials said.\\n\\nThese changes are being implemented through Medicare’s innovation center, created under the Obama-era Affordable Care Act and empowered to seek savings and improved quality. The Trump administration is relying on the innovation center even as it argues in federal court that the law that created it is unconstitutional and should be struck down entirely.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nOther initiatives will require new regulations, expected to be proposed later this year. Among them:\\n\\n—Allowing reimbursement of lost wages and other expenses for living donors, who can give one of their kidneys or a piece of their liver. The transplant recipient’s insurance pays the donor’s medical bills. But they are out of work for weeks recuperating and one study found more than a third of living kidney donors reported lost wages, a median of $2,712, in the year following donation. Details about who pays — and who qualifies — still have to be worked out.\\n\\n—Clearer ways to measure how well the nation’s 58 organ procurement organizations collect donations from deceased donors. Some do a better job than others, but today’s performance standards are self-reported, varying around the country and making it hard for government regulators or the OPOs themselves to take steps to improve.\\n\\n“Some OPOs are very aggressive and move forward with getting organs allocated and donors consented, and there are those that are a little more lackadaisical about it,” said Pittsburgh’s Tevar. Unlike the medical advances in transplantation, “we haven’t really made big dents and progress and moves in increasing cadaveric organs or increasing live donor options.”\\n\\nThis story is based on reporting by The Associated Press.'],\n",

       "'It also suggested that Johnson’s bumbling exterior conceals a ruthless tactician, ready to exploit any opening to bring about the split from the E.U. and consolidate power.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAbsent a delay, Britain will leave the European Union on Oct. 31.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf it leaves without a transition deal, analysts say, the country could face food and fuel shortages. The economic turmoil could spread to the E.U. nations, which collectively are the United States’ biggest trading partner. Many observers fear that with a hardened border, fresh violence could flare in Northern Ireland. And because President Trump has embraced Brexit and Johnson, the break with Europe would become a major test of the White House’s skepticism of multilateral institutions and trade blocs.\\n\\nIn Brussels, diplomats said they are increasingly convinced that Johnson will pilot Britain off the cliff without the safety net of a deal. European lawmakers expressed astonishment that he would so brazenly tie the hands of Parliament, in which a majority opposes a no-deal Brexit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Conservative prime minister denied claims that \\xadBrexit is the reason he sought the new timetable, telling reporters he wants a new session of Parliament so he can lay out the government’s “very exciting agenda.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe added that there would be “ample time” for lawmakers to debate Brexit.\\n\\nBut few in Britain, even among Johnson’s allies, accepted his explanation of why he had decided to ask Queen Elizabeth II to \\xad“prorogue” — or suspend — Parliament. The queen, who is on holiday at her Scottish estate of Balmoral, approved the request, as is customary.\\n\\nA “constitutional outrage,” John Bercow, speaker of the House of Commons, said in a statement. “However it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of prorogation now would be to stop Parliament debating Brexit and performing its duty.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nProroguing Parliament is not unheard of — it happens most years in connection with the queen’s speech, often in May or June. But the five-week gap this time is the longest break since 1945. Recent suspensions have been measured in days, not weeks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJohnson told reporters he asked the queen to give her usual annual speech outlining the country’s legislative agenda in mid-October, effectively suspending Parliament between Sept. 11 and Oct. 14.\\n\\nThe British pound swooned nearly 1 percent against the euro after the announcement before recovering slightly.\\n\\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn promised to fight the move.\\n\\n“Boris Johnson’s attempt to suspend parliament to avoid scrutiny of his plans for a reckless No Deal Brexit is an outrage and a threat to our democracy,” he wrote on Twitter. “Labour will work across Parliament to hold the government to account and prevent a disastrous No Deal.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe controversy drew the attention of Trump, who has gravitated toward Johnson as a fellow nationalist and goaded Britain to be more aggressive about Brexit. Trump and Johnson met over the weekend at the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz, France.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Would be very hard for Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain’s Labour Party, to seek a no-confidence vote,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Boris is exactly what the U.K. has been looking for, & will prove to be ‘a great one!’ ”\\n\\nOpposition leaders had talked earlier about forcing a vote of no confidence in Johnson’s government sometime before late October. Wednesday’s maneuver, if successful, would drastically narrow their window to next week or immediately before Britain drops out of the bloc.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThey could also try to pass a law mandating that Johnson seek a Brexit delay.\\n\\nBut given how badly the opposition forces are fractured, it is unclear whether they have the votes for either option. And they have precious little time.\\n\\n“Unless MPs come together to stop him next week, today will go down in history as a dark one indeed for UK democracy,” tweeted Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish National Party.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the rest of the European Union, leaders are bracing for Britain to leave without a deal. But there was anger — and some shock — that it could apparently happen with minimal input from Parliament.\\n\\n“We could see a no-deal Brexit coming. Now it’s a no-debate Brexit that’s looming,” tweeted Nathalie Loiseau, a member of the European Parliament and an ally of French President Emmanuel Macron. “What disease is British democracy suffering from to fear a debate before making one of the most important decisions in its history?”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGerman lawmaker Norbert Röttgen, an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel tweeted: “How does respect for democracy go together with suspending parliament?!”\\n\\nA petition launched on the British Parliament’s website calling for the government not to suspend the body quickly exceeded 100,000 signatures, the number needed for it to be considered for a parliamentary debate. The tally neared 1 million Wednesday night and was rocketing skyward, although any such debate would not lead to legislative action.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJohnson’s move infuriated some Conservative lawmakers who have sought to avoid a no-deal Brexit.\\n\\n“This is pretty unprecedented,” said Dominic Grieve, a Conservative lawmaker. He described it as “tantamount to a coup.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGrieve said he would consider voting against his own party if a no-confidence vote is called.\\n\\nJohnson appears to be gambling that those who are against a no-deal exit won’t be able to organize quickly enough to mount an effective opposition.\\n\\n“By using the political devices at hand, Boris has compressed everything into such a tight window that those who want to block a no-deal Brexit have a mountain of a task,” said Scott Lucas, a politics expert at the University of Birmingham, adding that he believed Wednesday’s move “sharply” increased the chance of a no-deal withdrawal.\\n\\nMany observers say Johnson is ramping up for a possible early general election, which he says he doesn’t want. At present, he has a working majority of just one. Even if he loses a confidence vote, it is not clear that Corbyn or anyone else would be able to form an alternative government, and Johnson could campaign in a new election on a staunch anti-E.U. platform, analysts said. He faces pressure from both flanks because the Brexit Party has been growing its support.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring a week of negotiations with other E.U. leaders, including over the weekend at the G-7 summit, Johnson left his counterparts feeling that he would prefer to exit with a deal, according to officials briefed on the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private assessments.\\n\\nBut leaders including Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel felt Johnson was ready to depart on the October deadline if no politically feasible deal materializes in the meantime, senior officials said.\\n\\nShort-circuiting debate on \\xadBrexit could push lawmakers, even skeptics, to vote for any new deal Johnson comes up with, just to avoid a no-deal departure.\\n\\nBut the officials said they think Johnson was setting an impossible task by demanding changes to the deal that would cross E.U. red lines, and they pegged the chances of a fresh compromise as low.\\n\\nAD'"

      "Handout . / Reuters Pelosi spoke for over seven hours on the House floor on Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) just made House history.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Democrat spoke for more than eight hours on the House floor Wednesday, adamant that she would not support any long-term budget deal without a commitment from House Speaker Paul Ryan to allow a chamber vote on protecting young undocumented immigrants. In the process, Pelosi set the record for the longest continuous speech in House history.\n",
      "\n",
      "The House Historian’s Office confirmed the lawmaker’s record to HuffPost. The previous record dates back to at least 1909 when a Missouri representative named Champ Clark spoke for 5 hours and 15 minutes against a tariff overhaul, the historian’s office said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her marathon speech ― which wrapped up around 6:10 p.m., about eight hours and five minutes after she started ― Pelosi called on lawmakers to pass the Dream Act, a bill that would grant legal status to undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children ― often called Dreamers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If a Dream Act were brought to the floor, it would pass immediately, with strong bipartisan support,” Pelosi said. “The Republican moral cowardice must end.” In September, President Donald Trump rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows Dreamers to obtain renewable two-year work permits. He set a six-month deadline for lawmakers to work out a legislative solution, meaning that after March 5, most DACA recipients would start to lose their status and be at risk of deportation. Senate leaders are working to finalize a two-year budget deal that would satisfy both Republicans and Democrats. The House passed a short-term bill on Tuesday to extend funding for the government until March 23. A top concern for many Democratic lawmakers is ensuring that any long-term spending bill doesn’t come at the expense of protecting Dreamers. Pelosi and other Democrats have called for a vote on the Dream Act, but House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has indicated his reluctance. “We’re not going to bring immigration legislation through that the president doesn’t support,” Ryan told reporters at a Tuesday news conference. But Pelosi is hoping to nonetheless convince Ryan to make a similar pledge to the one Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made last month that helped reopen the government. McConnell said on Tuesday that if Congress approves the funding bill on Thursday, the Senate will allow all members to present their ideas for immigration legislation moving forward.\n"

      "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment/house-panel-moves-to-intensify-trump-impeachment-probe-idUSKCN1VX10A\n",
      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted to intensify its investigation of Republican President Donald Trump on Thursday, as lawmakers edged closer to deciding whether to recommend his impeachment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 41-member panel adopted a resolution allowing it to designate hearings as impeachment proceedings, subject witnesses to more aggressive questioning and quicken the pace of an investigation that is expanding into areas that could prove politically explosive for both Trump and Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With these new procedures, we will begin next week an aggressive series of hearings investigating allegations of corruption, obstruction and abuse of power against the president,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler told reporters after a 24-17 vote along party lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "A more aggressive probe could also increase pressure on House Democratic leaders including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted impeachment of Trump as a politically risky step for moderate Democratic freshmen from swing districts where ousting the president is an unpopular idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Democrats have never gotten over the fact that I won the Election very fairly,” Trump said in a statement posted to his Facebook page hours after the vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If they go down the path of impeachment they will be dividing the nation! So ridiculous to even be talking about this subject when all of the crimes were committed by the other side,” the president said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump and his Republicans allies charge that former U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign’s possible collusion stemmed from an earlier effort to sink his candidacy, and later his presidency, by former officials at the Justice Department.\n",
      "\n",
      "LEWANDOWSKI TESTIMONY\n",
      "\n",
      "Republican lawmakers rejected the notion that the panel was pursuing an impeachment inquiry and dismissed the resolution as a “fantasy” intended to distract from Democrats’ unwillingness to have the full House authorize a formal impeachment inquiry, as occurred during the Watergate era and the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Republicans said Democrats lacked the votes to obtain formal House authorization and denounced Thursday’s action as a show intended to pander to Democratic voters who want Trump removed from office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Representative Doug Collins, the panel’s top Republican, said the resolution simply reiterates powers that the committee has had all along.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These rules are not new,” he said. “This is to make you believe something is happening, more than what’s actually happening.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nadler said that during the Watergate era, the House Judiciary Committee was already considering impeachment charges against then-President Richard Nixon and conducting a related probe when the House voted to authorize a formal inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slideshow ( 10 images )\n",
      "\n",
      "Committee Democrats plan to use the new tactics that allow an hour of questioning by committee lawyers of Corey Lewandowski, a close Trump confidant and one of his campaign managers in 2016. Lewandowski is due to appear before the panel next Tuesday for what may be a contentious hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats expect his testimony to help lay out a charge of obstruction of justice. But they are also pursuing allegations of campaign finance violations, witness tampering and unlawful self-enrichment through his business ventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats aim to decide by the end of the year whether to recommend articles of impeachment against Trump to the full House. If approved by the chamber, the Republican-controlled Senate would be left to hold a trial and consider the president’s ouster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slideshow ( 10 images )\n",
      "\n",
      "A Reuters head count shows that 135 House Democrats back an impeachment inquiry. While that is a majority of the caucus, the number is well short of the 218 votes needed to pass a resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only two American presidents have been impeached by the House: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Clinton in 1999. Neither was convicted by the Senate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nixon resigned in 1974 after the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment against him, but before the full House voted on the matter.\n"
