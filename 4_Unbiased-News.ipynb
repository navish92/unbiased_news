      "WASHINGTON  President Donald Trump announced he will nominate State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert to be the next ambassador to the United Nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am pleased to announce that Heather Nauert, Spokeswoman for the United States Department of State, will be nominated to serve as United Nations Ambassador. I want to congratulate Heather, and thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her great service to our Country!\" the president tweeted Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 48-year-old would replace Ambassador Nikki Haley who has been a vocal advocate for US foreign policy  and a strong supporter of Israel at the UN.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a tradition Sam Brownback, the US ambassador for International Religious Freedom, is confident Nauert will continue. He points to the time when President Trump moved the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, noting that Nauert faced the heat for the unpopular decision straight on as State Department spokesman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She stood up there and defended the ground because there was a lot of media and people around the world pushing against that...she's going to be a strong supporter of Israel. She already has been,\" he told CBN News.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of religious freedom, Brownback notes Nauert's intimate knowledge and the hands-on approach she took to the recent religious freedom ministerial conference at the State Department.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's been here at the highest levels dealing with issues of foreign affairs all over the place, a very strong voice for religious freedom when we did our religious freedom ministerial,\" Brownback said. \"She was out there pushing the topics...One of the key things from that position is the voice that you give because it is such a public position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nauert has served as the State Department spokesperson since April 2017. She was later appointed as acting undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, making the former broadcast journalist one of the highest ranking women in the agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump's nomination of Nauert comes at a time when the US finds itself embroiled in some tumultuous international relations with allies, like Canada and France. Struggles with authoritarian regimes such as Russia, China, North Korea and Saudi Arabia are also part of the daily headlines.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that in mind, some skeptics are concerned that Nauert, a former Fox News anchor, may not have enough experience to handle the UN post.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In terms of what we normally look for at the United Nations, her resume is very thin,\" David Gergen, who served in the Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Clinton administrations, told CNN's Anderson Cooper, adding that the UN post is not \"strictly a communications job.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Traditionally, we've either had people with a lot of experience in international affairs and/or a lot of experience as academics,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, some may have said the same about Haley when she was picked for the post since she had only served in state government. But conservatives deem her tenure at the UN to be a huge success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, critics like Indiana University international relations professor David Bosco are opposing the move. He tells USA Today, \"Her only real foreign policy is this stint at the State Department in a kind of spokesperson role. Nor does she have what Haley had, which was significant high-level governing experience. So, as I look at who we have had in this position over the decades, I think Nauert would be one of the least prepared for this position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, the White House appears confident Nauert is the right person to fill the role.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's very talented, very smart, very quick,\" the president told reporters gathered on the South Lawn of the White House Friday. \"I think she's going to be respected by all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nauert would need to be confirmed by the US Senate, but if she passes that hurdle, she would become a top voice for Trump's foreign policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one of her recent tweets, Nauert reflected a tough stance against Russia saying: \"Ten days since Russia attacked Ukrainian ships and detained 24 personnel in the Black Sea. We join the EU and our Allies in calling on #Russia to immediately release the sailors and their vessels. #Crimea is #Ukraine. #Peace4Ukraine\"\n"

The president complained that it would be a bad book, according to an audio recording of the conversation. Woodward replied that his work would be tough but factual and based on his reporting.\n",

      "<span class=\"highlight-green\">Again and again, Woodward recounts at length how Trumps national security team was shaken by his lack of curiosity and knowledge about world affairs and his contempt for the mainstream perspectives of military and intelligence leaders.</span>\n",

      "At a National Security Council meeting on Jan. 19, Trump disregarded the significance of the massive U.S. military presence on the Korean Peninsula, including a special intelligence operation that allows the United States to detect a North Korean missile launch in seven seconds vs. 15 minutes from Alaska, according to Woodward. Trump questioned why the government was spending resources in the region at all.\n",

      "AD\n",
      "\n",
      "In Woodwards telling, many top advisers were repeatedly unnerved by Trumps actions and expressed dim views of him. Secretaries of defense dont always get to choose the president they work for, Mattis told friends at one point, prompting laughter as he explained Trumps tendency to go off on tangents about subjects such as immigration and the news media.\n",
      "\n",
      "<span class=\"highlight-green\">Inside the White House, Woodward portrays an unsteady executive detached from the conventions of governing and prone to snapping at high-ranking staff members, whom he unsettled and belittled on a daily basis.</span>\n",

      "<span class=\"highlight-green\">White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly frequently lost his temper and told colleagues that he thought the president was unhinged, Woodward writes.</span> <span class=\"highlight-green\">In one small group meeting, Kelly said of Trump: Hes an idiot.</span> <span class=\"highlight-green\">Its pointless to try to convince him of anything.</span> Hes gone off the rails.

      "Trump apparently had little regard for Priebus. He once instructed then-staff secretary Rob Porter to ignore Priebus, even though Porter reported to the chief of staff, saying that Priebus was like a little rat. He just scurries around. \n",

      "<span class=\"highlight-green\">Few in Trumps orbit were protected from the presidents insults.</span> He often mocked then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster behind his back, puffing up his chest and exaggerating his breathing as he impersonated the retired Army general, and once said McMaster dresses in cheap suits, like a beer salesman.\n",

      "At a dinner with Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, among others, Trump lashed out at a vocal critic, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). He painted the former Navy pilot as cowardly, falsely suggesting he took an early release from a prisoner-of-war camp in Vietnam because of his fathers military rank and left others behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mattis swiftly corrected his boss: No, Mr. President, I think youve got it reversed. The defense secretary explained that McCain, who died Aug. 25, had in fact turned down early release and was brutally tortured during his five years at the Hanoi Hilton.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mattis told the president that he would get right on it. <span class=\"highlight-green\">But after hanging up the phone, he told a senior aide: Were not going to do any of that.</span> <span class=\"highlight-green\">Were going to be much more measured.</span> The national security team developed options for the more conventional airstrike that Trump ultimately ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cohn, a Wall Street veteran, tried to tamp down Trumps strident nationalism regarding trade. <span class=\"highlight-green\">According to Woodward, Cohn stole a letter off Trumps desk that the president was intending to sign to formally withdraw the United States from a trade agreement with South Korea.</span> <span class=\"highlight-green\">Cohn later told an associate that he removed the letter to protect national security and that Trump did not notice that it was missing.</span>\n",

      "Cohn made a similar play to prevent Trump from pulling the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, something the president has long threatened to do. In spring 2017, Trump was eager to withdraw from NAFTA and told Porter: Why arent we getting this done? Do your job. Its tap, tap, tap. Youre just tapping me along. I want to do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under orders from the president, Porter drafted a notification letter withdrawing from NAFTA. But he and other advisers worried that it could trigger an economic and foreign relations crisis. So Porter consulted Cohn, who told him, according to Woodward: I can stop this. Ill just take the paper off his desk.\n",

      "\n",
      "Cohn came to regard the president as a professional liar and threatened to resign in August 2017 over Trumps handling of a deadly white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville. Cohn, who is Jewish, was especially shaken when one of his daughters found a swastika on her college dorm room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump was sharply criticized for initially saying that both sides were to blame. At the urging of advisers, he then condemned white supremacists and neo-Nazis but almost immediately told aides, That was the biggest fucking mistake Ive made and the worst speech Ive ever given, according to Woodwards account.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Cohn met with Trump to deliver his resignation letter after Charlottesville, the president told him, This is treason, and persuaded his economic adviser to stay on. Kelly then confided to Cohn that he shared Cohns horror at Trumps handling of the tragedy  and shared Cohns fury with Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would have taken that resignation letter and shoved it up his ass six different times, Kelly told Cohn, according to Woodward. Kelly himself has threatened to quit several times but has not done so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Woodward illustrates how the dread in Trumps orbit became all-encompassing over the course of Trumps first year in office, leaving some staff members and Cabinet members confounded by the presidents lack of understanding about how government functions and his inability and unwillingness to learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point, Porter, who departed in February amid domestic abuse allegations, is quoted as saying, This was no longer a presidency. This is no longer a White House. This is a man being who he is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such moments of panic are a routine feature but not the thrust of Woodwards book, which mostly focuses on substantive decisions and internal disagreements, including tensions with North Korea as well as the future of U.S. policy in Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Woodward recounts repeated episodes of anxiety inside the government over Trumps handling of the North Korean nuclear threat. One month into his presidency, Trump asked Dunford for a plan for a preemptive military strike on North Korea, which rattled the combat veteran.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fall of 2017, as Trump intensified a war of words with Kim Jong Un, nicknaming North Koreas dictator Little Rocket Man in a speech at the United Nations, aides worried the president might be provoking Kim. But, Woodward writes, Trump told Porter that he saw the situation as a contest of wills: This is all about leader versus leader. Man versus man. Me versus Kim.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book also details Trumps impatience with the war in Afghanistan, which had become the United States longest conflict. At a July 2017 National Security Council meeting, Trump dressed down his generals and other advisers for 25 minutes, complaining that the United States was losing, according to Woodward.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soldiers on the ground could run things much better than you, Trump told them. They could do a much better job. I dont know what the hell were doing. He went on to ask: How many more deaths? How many more lost limbs? How much longer are we going to be there?\n",
      "\n",
      "The presidents family members, while sometimes touted as his key advisers by other Trump chroniclers, are minor players in Woodwards account, popping up occasionally in the West Wing and vexing adversaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Woodward recounts an expletive-laden altercation between Ivanka Trump, the presidents eldest daughter and senior adviser, and Stephen K. Bannon, then the chief White House strategist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Youre a goddamn staffer! Bannon screamed at her, telling her that she had to work through Priebus like other aides. You walk around this place and act like youre in charge, and youre not. Youre on staff!\n",
      "\n",
      "Ivanka Trump, who had special access to the president and worked around Priebus, replied: Im not a staffer! Ill never be a staffer. Im the first daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such tensions boiled among many of Trumps core advisers. Priebus is quoted as describing Trump officials not as rivals but as natural predators.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you put a snake and a rat and a falcon and a rabbit and a shark and a seal in a zoo without walls, things start getting nasty and bloody, Priebus says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovering over the White House was Muellers inquiry, which deeply embarrassed the president. Woodward describes Trump calling his Egyptian counterpart to secure the release of an imprisoned charity worker and President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi saying: Donald, Im worried about this investigation. Are you going to be around?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump relayed the conversation to Dowd and said it was like a kick in the nuts, according to Woodward.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book vividly recounts the ongoing debate between Trump and his attorneys about whether the president would sit for an interview with Mueller. On March 5, Dowd and Trump attorney Jay Sekulow met in Muellers office with the special counsel and his deputy, James Quarles, where Dowd and Sekulow reenacted Trumps January practice session.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dowd then explained to Mueller and Quarles why he was trying to keep the president from testifying: Im not going to sit there and let him look like an idiot. And you publish that transcript, because everything leaks in Washington, and the guys overseas are going to say, I told you he was an idiot. I told you he was a goddamn dumbbell. What are we dealing with this idiot for? \n",
      "\n",
      "John, I understand, Mueller replied, according to Woodward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later that month, Dowd told Trump: Dont testify. Its either that or an orange jumpsuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Trump, concerned about the optics of a president refusing to testify and convinced that he could handle Muellers questions, had by then decided otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ill be a real good witness, Trump told Dowd, according to Woodward.\n",
      "\n",

      "Dr. Anthony Fauci, the face of the White House coronavirus task force, warned in testimony Tuesday before the Senate Health Committee that reopening the economy before certain \"checkpoints\" set up in the Trump administration's coronavirus recovery plan are met could bring \"serious\" consequences.\n",
      "\"As I have said many times publicly, what we have worked out is a guideline framework for how to open America again, Fauci said, referencing a set of guidelines the White House has released for states and localities to begin opening their economies.\n",
      "If some areas, cities, states or what-have-you, jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently, my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks, said Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n",
      "If some areas, cities, states or what-have-you jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently, my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks, said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n",
      "Anthony S. Fauci, the nations top infectious-diseases expert, predicted Americans would experience suffering and death that could be avoided, as well as additional economic damage, if states ignore federal guidelines, including delaying reopening of most businesses until they see dramatic declines in cases.\n",
      "Link copied link Premature openings could be dangerous, Fauci says By Mike DeBonis Pressed by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Fauci warned that states that fail to obey federal reopening guidelines and move too quickly to restart their economies would put themselves at risk of new outbreaks that could be hard to control.\n",
      "Warren went on to question Fauci about the risks of a possible fall resurgence of the virus and whether the federal government would be prepared to handle it.\n",
      "I think were going in the right direction, but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak, Fauci said.\n",
      "So I think we're going in the right direction, but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak.\"\n",
      "He said the U.S. should be in a much better place by the fall, but said if adequate measures are not taken, \"there will be problems.\"\n",
      "I feel about vaccines like I feel about tests: This is going to go away without a vaccine, Trump said Friday, adding that there could be flare-ups, including in the fall, but that covid-19 would go away regardless.\n",
      "Redfield deemed the pandemic the most serious public health crisis in more than a century and detailed the CDCs efforts to combat it, including expert assistance to state health authorities, disease surveillance and testing and contact tracing strategy.\n",
      "Fauci did not rip on the Trump administration's response to the pandemic in his planned remarks, instead emphasizing efforts by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop vaccines and other medical means to fight the coronavirus.\n",
      "Link copied link Hahn: Evolving clinical picture of virus affects FDAs search for treatments By Laurie McGinley Hahn said new information about the virus and how it manifests itself in the body affects the endpoints the FDA is looking for in new drugs to treat covid-19.\n",
      "\"These efforts will improve our response to the current pandemic and bolster our preparedness for the next, inevitable emerging disease outbreak\"\n",
      "That is just not going to happen, Fauci said of the notion the virus would disappear on its own.\n",
      "There is certainly not a confrontational relationship between me and the president, Fauci said.\n",
      "Kaine pushed Fauci on whether South Korea's success on fighting the coronavirus showed that the U.S. response to the pandemic was inadequate.\n",
      "Fauci pointed to New York City, where he said the health-care system faced an extraordinary challenge during the peak of the outbreak, and people could have died at home of coronavirus without being officially counted.\n",
      "\"After consulting with Dr. Fauci, and in an abundance of caution for our witnesses, senators, and the staff, all four Administration witnesses will appear by videoconference due to these unusual circumstances,\" Alexander said in a statement.\n",
      "Alexander, in his opening remarks, emphasized the necessity of testing and also said the government might make an effort to mass-manufacture a vaccine before its been proven to work so it can be quickly distributed once its officially approved.\n",
      "Trumps claims about U.S. testing benchmarks do not account for what health experts have criticized as the slow pace of testing capability in the United States this spring, a delay that some say contributed to the rapid spread of the virus, the mounting death toll and uncertainty about the way forward.\n",
      "In response to repeated questions about when better therapeutics and a vaccine would be available, Fauci dismissed the notion they might be in use by the time schools reopen in the fall.\n",
      "The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate reentry of students into fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far, he said.\n",
      "Any loosening of restrictions, Fauci added, would lead to new cases, but those new cases could be manageable so long as states have the proper infrastructure in place.\n",
      "\"I would hope that if we do have the threat of a second wave, we will be able to deal with it very effectively to prevent it from becoming an outbreak.\n",
      "Admiral Brett Giroir, the Assistant Secretary for Health, emphasized that the U.S. had conducted \"more than 9 million COVID-19 tests, a number far greater than any other country and double the per capita tests performed to date in South Korea,\" a nation that many have held up as the model for handling the coronavirus' effects.\n",
      "Link copied link Giroir: 40 million to 50 million tests per month by September By Donna Cassata Giroir, the federal official overseeing coronavirus testing efforts, said the nation will be able to conduct more tests for the novel coronavirus in the coming months, a critical step to reopening the country.\n",
      "Fauci got into a dustup with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., over Paul's criticism of some of the prognostications that have come from public health experts and the push to reopen schools quickly.\n",
      "After asking to respond, Fauci told Paul, Ive never made myself out to be the end-all.\n",
      "I give advice, opinion based on evidence-based scientific information.\n",
      "He continued, emphasizing that it is not clear children are generally immune from the harmful effects of the coronavirus: \"We should be humble about what we don't know.\n",
      "Fauci asked to respond, and then warned that while the numbers indicate that the virus is less dangerous to children than adults and the elderly, we dont know everything about this virus.\n",
      "Because the more and more we learn, we're seeing things about what this virus can do that we didn't see from the studies in China or in Europe.\"\n",
      "During questioning, self-proclaimed Democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pushed the witnesses on whether or not a vaccine, once developed, would be broadly available to people regardless of their income.\n",
      "As this and more therapeutics and ultimately a vaccine come onto the marketplace, how can these allocations and distribution issues be resolved so that patient care is not delayed and so it doesnt depend on which state you live in, whether you are going to get access to these treatments, and ultimately a vaccine?''\n",
      "Link copied link FDA head Hahn: Agency is working to bridge the gap to a vaccine through treatments By Laurie McGinley Hahn, head of the Food and Drug Administration, said the agency is working to bridge the gap between now and when a vaccine might be available through therapeutics.\n",
      "I will certainly advocate that everyone is able to receive the vaccine regardless of income or any other circumstance,\" Hahn said.\n"
