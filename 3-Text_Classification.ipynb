       "      <td>WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump announced he will nominate State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert to be the next ambassador to the United Nations.\\n\\n\"I am pleased to announce that Heather Nauert, Spokeswoman for the United States Department of State, will be nominated to serve as United Nations Ambassador. I want to congratulate Heather, and thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her great service to our Country!\" the president tweeted Friday.\\n\\nThe 48-year-old would replace Ambassador Nikki Haley who has been a vocal advocate for US foreign policy – and a strong supporter of Israel at the UN.\\n\\nIt's a tradition Sam Brownback, the US ambassador for International Religious Freedom, is confident Nauert will continue. He points to the time when President Trump moved the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, noting that Nauert faced the heat for the unpopular decision straight on as State Department spokesman.\\n\\n\"She stood up there and defended the ground because there was a lot of media and people around the world pushing against that...she's going to be a strong supporter of Israel. She already has been,\" he told CBN News.\\n\\nIn terms of religious freedom, Brownback notes Nauert's intimate knowledge and the hands-on approach she took to the recent religious freedom ministerial conference at the State Department.\\n\\n\"She's been here at the highest levels dealing with issues of foreign affairs all over the place, a very strong voice for religious freedom when we did our religious freedom ministerial,\" Brownback said. \"She was out there pushing the topics...One of the key things from that position is the voice that you give because it is such a public position.\"\\n\\nNauert has served as the State Department spokesperson since April 2017. She was later appointed as acting undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, making the former broadcast journalist one of the highest ranking women in the agency.\\n\\nTrump's nomination of Nauert comes at a time when the US finds itself embroiled in some tumultuous international relations with allies, like Canada and France. Struggles with authoritarian regimes such as Russia, China, North Korea and Saudi Arabia are also part of the daily headlines.\\n\\nWith that in mind, some skeptics are concerned that Nauert, a former Fox News anchor, may not have enough experience to handle the UN post.\\n\\n\"In terms of what we normally look for at the United Nations, her resume is very thin,\" David Gergen, who served in the Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Clinton administrations, told CNN's Anderson Cooper, adding that the UN post is not \"strictly a communications job.\"\\n\\n\"Traditionally, we've either had people with a lot of experience in international affairs and/or a lot of experience as academics,\" he said.\\n\\nHowever, some may have said the same about Haley when she was picked for the post since she had only served in state government. But conservatives deem her tenure at the UN to be a huge success.\\n\\nStill, critics like Indiana University international relations professor David Bosco are opposing the move. He tells USA Today, \"Her only real foreign policy is this stint at the State Department in a kind of spokesperson role. Nor does she have what Haley had, which was significant high-level governing experience. So, as I look at who we have had in this position over the decades, I think Nauert would be one of the least prepared for this position.\"\\n\\nNevertheless, the White House appears confident Nauert is the right person to fill the role.\\n\\n\"She's very talented, very smart, very quick,\" the president told reporters gathered on the South Lawn of the White House Friday. \"I think she's going to be respected by all.\"\\n\\nNauert would need to be confirmed by the US Senate, but if she passes that hurdle, she would become a top voice for Trump's foreign policy.\\n\\nIn one of her recent tweets, Nauert reflected a tough stance against Russia saying: \"Ten days since Russia attacked Ukrainian ships and detained 24 personnel in the Black Sea. We join the EU and our Allies in calling on #Russia to immediately release the sailors and their vessels. #Crimea is #Ukraine. #Peace4Ukraine\"</td>\n",

       "931  WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump announced he will nominate State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert to be the next ambassador to the United Nations.\\n\\n\"I am pleased to announce that Heather Nauert, Spokeswoman for the United States Department of State, will be nominated to serve as United Nations Ambassador. I want to congratulate Heather, and thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her great service to our Country!\" the president tweeted Friday.\\n\\nThe 48-year-old would replace Ambassador Nikki Haley who has been a vocal advocate for US foreign policy – and a strong supporter of Israel at the UN.\\n\\nIt's a tradition Sam Brownback, the US ambassador for International Religious Freedom, is confident Nauert will continue. He points to the time when President Trump moved the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, noting that Nauert faced the heat for the unpopular decision straight on as State Department spokesman.\\n\\n\"She stood up there and defended the ground because there was a lot of media and people around the world pushing against that...she's going to be a strong supporter of Israel. She already has been,\" he told CBN News.\\n\\nIn terms of religious freedom, Brownback notes Nauert's intimate knowledge and the hands-on approach she took to the recent religious freedom ministerial conference at the State Department.\\n\\n\"She's been here at the highest levels dealing with issues of foreign affairs all over the place, a very strong voice for religious freedom when we did our religious freedom ministerial,\" Brownback said. \"She was out there pushing the topics...One of the key things from that position is the voice that you give because it is such a public position.\"\\n\\nNauert has served as the State Department spokesperson since April 2017. She was later appointed as acting undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, making the former broadcast journalist one of the highest ranking women in the agency.\\n\\nTrump's nomination of Nauert comes at a time when the US finds itself embroiled in some tumultuous international relations with allies, like Canada and France. Struggles with authoritarian regimes such as Russia, China, North Korea and Saudi Arabia are also part of the daily headlines.\\n\\nWith that in mind, some skeptics are concerned that Nauert, a former Fox News anchor, may not have enough experience to handle the UN post.\\n\\n\"In terms of what we normally look for at the United Nations, her resume is very thin,\" David Gergen, who served in the Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Clinton administrations, told CNN's Anderson Cooper, adding that the UN post is not \"strictly a communications job.\"\\n\\n\"Traditionally, we've either had people with a lot of experience in international affairs and/or a lot of experience as academics,\" he said.\\n\\nHowever, some may have said the same about Haley when she was picked for the post since she had only served in state government. But conservatives deem her tenure at the UN to be a huge success.\\n\\nStill, critics like Indiana University international relations professor David Bosco are opposing the move. He tells USA Today, \"Her only real foreign policy is this stint at the State Department in a kind of spokesperson role. Nor does she have what Haley had, which was significant high-level governing experience. So, as I look at who we have had in this position over the decades, I think Nauert would be one of the least prepared for this position.\"\\n\\nNevertheless, the White House appears confident Nauert is the right person to fill the role.\\n\\n\"She's very talented, very smart, very quick,\" the president told reporters gathered on the South Lawn of the White House Friday. \"I think she's going to be respected by all.\"\\n\\nNauert would need to be confirmed by the US Senate, but if she passes that hurdle, she would become a top voice for Trump's foreign policy.\\n\\nIn one of her recent tweets, Nauert reflected a tough stance against Russia saying: \"Ten days since Russia attacked Ukrainian ships and detained 24 personnel in the Black Sea. We join the EU and our Allies in calling on #Russia to immediately release the sailors and their vessels. #Crimea is #Ukraine. #Peace4Ukraine\"  "

       "        'DETROIT  Detroit, the cradle of Americas automobile industry and once the nations fourth-most-populous city, filed for bankruptcy on Thursday, the largest American city ever to take such a course.\\n\\nThe decision, confirmed by officials after it trickled out in late afternoon news reports, also amounts to the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in American history in terms of debt. \\n\\nThis is a difficult step, but the only viable option to address a problem that has been six decades in the making, said Gov. Rick Snyder, who authorized the move after a recommendation from the emergency financial manager he had appointed to resolve Detroits dire financial situation. \\n\\nNot everyone agrees how much Detroit owes, but Kevyn D. Orr, the emergency manager, has said the debt is likely to be $18 billion and perhaps as much as $20 billion.\\n\\nFor Detroit, the filing came as a painful reminder of a citys rise and fall. \\n\\nIts sad, but you could see the writing on the wall, said Terence Tyson, a city worker who learned of the bankruptcy as he left his job at Detroits municipal building on Thursday evening. Like many there, he seemed to react with muted resignation and uncertainty about what lies ahead, but not surprise. This has been coming for ages.\\n\\nDetroit expanded at a stunning rate in the first half of the 20th century with the arrival of the automobile industry, and then shrank away in recent decades at a similarly remarkable pace. A city of 1.8 million in 1950, it is now home to 700,000 people, as well as to tens of thousands of abandoned buildings, vacant lots and unlit streets.\\n\\nFrom here, there is no road map for Detroits recovery, not least of all because municipal bankruptcies are rare. State officials said ordinary city business would carry on as before, even as city leaders take their case to a judge, first to prove that the city is so financially troubled as to be eligible for bankruptcy, and later to argue that Detroits creditors and representatives of city workers and municipal retirees ought to settle for less than they once expected.\\n\\nSome bankruptcy experts and city leaders bemoaned the likely fallout from the filing, including the stigma. They anticipate further benefit cuts for city workers and retirees, more reductions in services for residents, and a detrimental effect on borrowing.\\n\\nFor a struggling family I can see bankruptcy, but for a big city like this, can it really work? said Diane Robinson, an office assistant who has worked for the city for 20 years. What will happen to city retirees on fixed incomes?\\n\\nBut others, including some Detroit business leaders who have seen a rise in private investment downtown despite the citys larger struggles, said bankruptcy seemed the only choice left  and one that might finally lead to a desperately needed overhaul of city services and to a plan to pay off some reduced version of the overwhelming debts. In short, a new start.\\n\\nThe worst thing we can do is ignore a problem, said Sandy K. Baruah, president of the Detroit Regional Chamber. Were finally executing a fix.\\n\\nThe decision to go to court signaled a breakdown after weeks of tense negotiations, in which Mr. Orr had been trying to persuade creditors to accept pennies on the dollar and unions to accept cuts in benefits.\\n\\nAll along, the states involvement  including Mr. Snyders decision to send in an emergency manager  has carried racial implications, setting off a wave of concerns for some in Detroit that the mostly white Republican-led state government was trying to seize control of Detroit, a Democratic city where more than 80 percent of residents are black.\\n\\nThe nature of Detroits situation ensures that it will be watched intensely by the municipal bond market, by public sector unions, and by leaders of other financially challenged cities around the country. Just over 60 cities, towns, villages and counties have filed under Chapter 9, the court proceeding used by municipalities, since the mid-1950s. \\n\\nLeaders in Washington and in Lansing, the state capital, issued statements of concern late Thursday. A White House spokeswoman said President Obama and his senior team were closely monitoring the situation.\\n\\nWhile leaders on the ground in Michigan and the citys creditors understand that they must find a solution to Detroits serious financial challenge, we remain committed to continuing our strong partnership with Detroit as it works to recover and revitalize and maintain its status as one of Americas great cities, Amy Brundage, the spokeswoman, said in a statement.\\n\\nThe debt in Detroit dwarfs that of Jefferson County, Ala., which had been the nations largest municipal bankruptcy, having filed in 2011 with about $4 billion in debt. The population of Detroit, the largest city in Michigan, is more than twice that of Stockton, Calif., which filed for bankruptcy in 2012 and had been the nations most populous city to do so.\\n\\nOther major cities, including New York and Cleveland in the 1970s and Philadelphia two decades later, have teetered near the edge of financial ruin, but ultimately found solutions other than federal court. Detroits struggle, experts say, is particularly dire because it is not limited to a single event or one failed financial deal, like the troubled sewer system largely responsible for Jefferson Countys downfall.\\n\\nInstead, numerous factors over many years have brought Detroit to this point, including a shrunken tax base but still a huge, 139-square-mile city to maintain; overwhelming health care and pension costs; repeated efforts to manage mounting debts with still more borrowing; annual deficits in the citys operating budget since 2008; and city services crippled by aged computer systems, poor record-keeping and widespread dysfunction.\\n\\nAll of that makes bankruptcy  a process that could take months, if not years, and is itself expected to be costly  particularly complex.\\n\\nIts not enough to say, lets reduce debt, said James E. Spiotto, an expert in municipal bankruptcy at the law firm of Chapman and Cutler in Chicago. At the end of the day, you need a real recovery plan. Otherwise youre just going to repeat the whole thing over again.\\n\\nThe municipal bond market will be paying particular attention to Detroit because of what it may mean for investing in general obligation bonds. In recent weeks, as Detroit officials have proposed paying off small fractions of what the city owes, they have indicated they intend to treat investors holding general obligation bonds as having no higher priority for payment than, for instance, city workers  a notion that conflicts with the conventions of the market, where general obligation bonds have been seen as among the safest investments and all but certain to be paid in full.\\n\\nLeaders of public sector unions and municipal retirees around the nation will be focused on whether Detroit is permitted to slash pension benefits, despite a provision in the State Constitution that union leaders say bars such cuts.\\n\\nOfficials in other financially troubled cities may feel encouraged to follow Detroits path, some experts say. A rush of municipal bankruptcies appears unlikely, though, and leaders of other cities will want to see how this case turns out, particularly when it comes to pension and retiree health care costs, said Karol K. Denniston, a bankruptcy lawyer with Schiff Hardin who is advising a taxpayer group that came together in Stockton after its bankruptcy.\\n\\nIf you end up with precedent that allows the restructuring of retirement benefits in bankruptcy court, that will make it an attractive option for cities, Ms. Denniston said. Detroit is going to be a huge test kitchen.\\n\\nAround this city, there was widespread uncertainty about what bankruptcy might really mean, now and in the long term. Officials said city workers were being sent letters, notifying them that city business would proceed as usual, from bills to permits. A hot line was planned for residents and others with questions and worries.\\n\\nFor some Detroiters, recent memories of bankruptcies by Chrysler and General Motors  and the re-emergence of those companies  appeared to have calmed nerves. But experts say corporate bankruptcy procedures are significantly different from municipal bankruptcies.\\n\\nIn municipal bankruptcies, for instance, the ability of judges to intervene in how a city is run is sharply limited. And municipal bankruptcies are a form of debt adjustment, as opposed to liquidation or reorganization. \\n\\nHere, residents are likely to see little immediate change from the way the city has been run since March, when Mr. Orr arrived to oversee major decisions. A bankruptcy lawyer, he is widely expected to continue to run Detroit during a legal process. Mayor Dave Bing and Detroits elected City Council are still paid to hold office and are permitted to make decisions about day-to-day operations, though Mr. Orr could remove those powers.\\n\\nMr. Orr has said that as part of any restructuring he wants to spend about $1.25 billion on improving city infrastructure and services. But a major concern for Detroit residents remains the possibility that services, already severely lacking, might be further diminished in bankruptcy.\\n\\nAbout 40 percent of the citys streetlights do not work, a report from Mr. Orrs office showed. More than half of Detroits parks have closed since 2008.'],\n",

       "        'We refused to throw in the towel and do nothing. We refused to let Detroit go bankrupt. We bet on American workers and American ingenuity, and three years later, that bet is paying off in a big way.\\n\\n-- President Obama in his weekly address, Oct. 13, 2012.\\n\\nJust before Detroit became the largest municipality to ever file bankruptcy, the failed citys emergency manager, Kevin Orr, pleaded with top White House officials, including senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, for help.\\n\\nBut no help was coming.\\n\\nThat detail in the Wall Street Journals coverage of how the once-great city, now $11 billion in debt, finally succumbed may be the most telling of any in the slew of obituaries for Detroit.\\n\\nFor all of the invective launched by President Obama and his campaign against challenger Mitt Romney last year for having argued for structured bankruptcy for the citys Big Three automakers, in the end, the most liberal, most pro-union president since LBJ opted to take Romneys advice when it came to the city itself.\\n\\nDetroit has been teetering on the brink for years. Its huge debt is mostly from unfunded employee benefit programs, constituting some $9 billion of the total. Those pensions and bennies were negotiated in fatter days for government worker unions there, but the contracts stayed in place long after the collapse of the Big Threes superpower status made such self-dealing for government workers and the Democrats they patronized unsustainable.\\n\\nHaving seen the flight of taxpayers accelerate as the economy worsened and city services and safety declined, theres no reason to believe that Detroit will ever be able to pay anything but pennies on the dollar to those who have bought its bonds and only slightly more to those unionized retirees.\\n\\nA place where nearly half of the streetlights dont work anymore, the violent crime rate is higher than any other major city and the average police response time is one hour doesnt attract new residents. It either loses them more quickly or more slowly, a critical mass of despicability having been achieved. In the 21st Century, the pace of the exodus has been blinding: the city has lost 26 percent of its population since 2000.\\n\\nThe only thing that the producers of RoboCop seem to have missed was that there wouldnt be enough money to buy murderous, law-enforcement robots. Much of Detroit is simply falling apart and being reclaimed by the natural world. The Motor City is becoming the domain of raccoons and coyotes, not an evil international mega corporation.\\n\\nDavid Byrne may have said it best: This used to be real estate. Now it\\'s only fields and trees.\\n\\nSo it hardly would have made sense for Obama to have put together a loan package for the city. Delaying the inevitable for a place that keeps finding new kinds of rock bottom would have not only been illogical but also politically impractical for a president who is already under fire for his stance in federal fiscal fights: borrow more now to expand government outlays as an investment in the future.\\n\\nIn Detroit, 40 years of such investments have brought sorrow as their only return. Certainly Obama, who is promising a smarter, more efficient federal government, would not like to be seen standing with a city that has become synonymous with the excesses of government worker unions, Democratic machine politics and corruption.\\n\\nObama would no more deliver a loan package to Detroit than he would announce a new green energy stimulus program at the remains of the Solyndra world headquarters. Bad optics.\\n\\n[pullquote]\\n\\nBut, its still an instructive moment for organized labor in America.\\n\\nUnion members are happy to see that not only have Republicans in the Senate agreed to confirm two union labor lawyers to the National Labor Relations Board and a crusading liberal in Thomas Perez as Labor secretary.\\n\\nObamas dismissing of Detroits last-minute pleas, though, shows where Big Labor really stands in Obamas remade Democratic coalition. While the president is engaging young singles in the cities with promises of free contraceptives, liberal social policies and global warming curbs, the old unions who made the Democratic Party great are left to crumble like Detroits streets and sidewalks.\\n\\nWe saw in a letter to Democratic leaders this week evidence of the broadening realization among unions that Obamas 2010 health law is a disaster for them: Fewer members, less money and less clout in addition to difficult regulations for their own existing health plans.\\n\\nIn an interview with the Washington Post, Thea Lee, an economist and deputy chief of staff for the AFL-CIO, described the presidents economic policies as schizophrenic. She bashed Republicans for glorying in the perennially weak economy as evidence of Obamas failures, but also lamented the presidents doublespeak on fiscal issues.\\n\\nThey wanted the 2008 version of Obama who would crusade for domestic spending, not the guy trying to sound like a fiscal moderate in face of Republican attacks on his deficit spending and mounting debts.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pathetic recovery,\" Lee told the Post. \"It really is extraordinary that four years ago we declared the recession over, but we\\'re not even within spitting distance of full employment.\"\\n\\nOne doubts that the Obama of 2008 would have brushed off Detroits bailout pleas, certainly not when he was looking for union endorsements. Nor would their worries about his health law have gone unanswered. But when the elections are all over, Obamas not looking for the union label anymore.\\n\\nUnions are facing the same fate as the city they made and the president cant do much about it. What is galling for them, though, is that he doesnt even seem willing to fight for them in public.\\n\\nUnited Auto Workers plants were key backdrops for Obamas re-election campaign, with the president endlessly touting his industry bailout and support for union workers. But when the chips were down for their city, their calls went unanswered.\\n\\nWhile Vice President Joe Bidens slogan, Usama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive, remains true, the second part of that seems to be doing a lot more for Shanghai, where GM broke ground on another new plant last month, than it is for a bankrupt Detroit.\\n\\nAnd Now, A Word From Charles\\n\\nThe United States, which dominated the world economically, created all of these programs  entitlements: Social Security, Medicare, and now added on Obamacare  living on the glories of the past when we were the most dominant without any rivals of the world, and now having to adapt to a reduced economy, are we going to be able to have commensurate cuts. And when you see all of the resistance to anything of that sort by especially Democrats and liberals, it doesn\\'t give one a lot of hope. In the end, you can have a bankruptcy for a city, but not for a country.\\n\\n-- Charles Krauthammer on Special Report with Bret Baier.\\n\\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News, and his POWER PLAY column appears Monday-Friday on FoxNews.com.

       "      <td>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the states congressional map went so far to benefit Republicans that it clearly, plainly and palpably violated the state constitution.\\n\\nThe court, where Democrats have a 5-2 majority, blocked the use of the map in the 2018 midterm elections, ordered state lawmakers to begin to draw a new map.\\n\\nThe suit against the congressional map, which only challenged it under Pennsylvanias state constitution, was one of the most watched voting rights cases in the country. The ruling could encourage groups to bring similar challenges against congressional gerrymandering cases in other states and bypass a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, which is currently considering two cases dealing with partisan gerrymandering.\\n\\nPennsylvania has been described as one of the worst gerrymandered states in the country, and analyses have found the map is responsible for at least three additional GOP seats in Congress. Republicans controlled the redistricting process in 2010 and drew the map to give them a considerable advantage. In the 2012, 2014 and 2016 elections they won 13 of the states 18 congressional seats, despite just winning about 50 percent of the vote.\\n\\nThe suit, brought by the League of Women Voters on behalf of 18 voters in each of the states congressional districts, said that GOP lawmakers had retaliated against Democratic voters for supporting Democratic candidates, violating the equal protection and free expression guarantees in the state constitution.\\n\\nThe justices gave GOP lawmakers until Feb. 9 to submit a new map and gave Gov. Tom Wolf (D) until Feb. 15 to approve it. Should the parties fail to reach an agreement on the plan, the justices said the court would move quickly on its own to develop a constitutional congressional map. The court said the new map could be expected by Feb. 19.\\n\\nPennsylvania voters will finally be able to cast their ballots in districts that were fairly and constitutionally drawn, David Gersch, one of the lawyers who argued the case on behalf of the plaintiffs, said in a call with reporters on Monday. This is a tremendous day for Pennsylvania, tremendous day for the voters and its also a tremendous step by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.The current map is the worst map in Pennsylvanias history.\\n\\nThe justices indicated the states congressional primary on May 15 would proceed as scheduled.\\n\\nThe court only issued an order on Monday and said a full opinion would follow. In a dissenting statement, the courts two Republicans, Chief Justice Thomas Saylor and Sallie Updyke Mundy, said they would not have issued a ruling until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on its partisan gerrymandering cases. They agreed with a lower courts finding, however, that the map raised substantial concerns about constitutional viability. In a separate dissenting opinion, Mundy expressed concern with the vagueness of the courts order, arguing it had instructed the legislature to redraw the states congressional map without giving it any guidance on how to do so.\\n\\nJustice Max Baer (D) wrote an opinion joining the majority in part and dissenting in part. He said he would have held off on redrawing the congressional map until 2020 so it didnt throw the states 2018 midterm elections into chaos and confusion.\\n\\nAt oral arguments in Harrisburg last week, lawyers for House Speaker Michael Turzai (R) and Senate President Tempore Joseph Scarnati (R) defended the map, saying that courts had never articulated a standard for when partisan gerrymandering was so egregious that it could be unconstitutional.\\n\\nE. Mark Braden, a lawyer for Turzai, said it was inconceivable that a political body like a legislature, which is constitutionally tasked with drawing lines for Congress, would not take partisan considerations into account.\\n\\nScarnati and Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman (R) criticized the Pennsylvania Supreme Courts decision on Monday, saying they intended to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to block the order to redraw the map.\\n\\nTodays ruling by the State Supreme Court is a partisan action showing a distinct lack of respect for the Constitution and the legislative process. The PA Supreme Court has overstepped its legal authority and set up an impossible deadline that will only introduce chaos in the upcoming Congressional election. The Court had this case since Nov. 9, 2017  giving it over 10 weeks to reach this decision, they said in a joint statement. Yet, it has elected to give the legislature 19 days to redraw and adopt the Congressional Districts. With matters the Supreme Court found unconstitutional in the past, it afforded the General Assembly four months to make corrections.\\n\\nThe statement continued, saying: It is clear that with this ruling the Court is attempting to bypass the Constitution and the legislative process and legislate themselves, directly from the bench.\\n\\nGov. Wolf, a named defendant in the suit who supported striking down the maps, said his administration was assessing next steps. Wolf would have to sign off on any maps passed by the legislature.\\n\\nI strongly believe that gerrymandering is wrong and consistently have stated that the current maps are unfair to Pennsylvanians. My administration is reviewing the order and we are assessing the executive branchs next steps in this process, he said in a statement.\\n\\nR. Stanton Jones, another lawyer for the plaintiffs, told reporters that any appeal would be unsuccessful because the challenge to the congressional map was only brought under the state constitution, not the federal one.\\n\\nIts well established that the United States Supreme Court does not review decisions of state court that exclusively construe state law, which is the exact situation you have here, Jones said. When people talk about federalism, the concept of federalism, this is an important part of it. The United States Supreme Court doesnt get to tell a states highest court what is state law, in this case Pennsylvania law.\\n\\nDemocrats praised the courts verdict.\\n\\nThis ruling is one more example of the courts telling Republican legislatures that drawing district lines for partisan purposes violates our democratic principles, said former Attorney General Eric Holder, now head of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, in a statement. What the Republican party has been doing diminishes the voting power of Americans and contributes to the polarization of our political system. This year, Pennsylvania voters can finally look forward to casting ballots under a fair and legal congressional map.</td>\n",

       "762  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the states congressional map went so far to benefit Republicans that it clearly, plainly and palpably violated the state constitution.\\n\\nThe court, where Democrats have a 5-2 majority, blocked the use of the map in the 2018 midterm elections, ordered state lawmakers to begin to draw a new map.\\n\\nThe suit against the congressional map, which only challenged it under Pennsylvanias state constitution, was one of the most watched voting rights cases in the country. The ruling could encourage groups to bring similar challenges against congressional gerrymandering cases in other states and bypass a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, which is currently considering two cases dealing with partisan gerrymandering.\\n\\nPennsylvania has been described as one of the worst gerrymandered states in the country, and analyses have found the map is responsible for at least three additional GOP seats in Congress. Republicans controlled the redistricting process in 2010 and drew the map to give them a considerable advantage. In the 2012, 2014 and 2016 elections they won 13 of the states 18 congressional seats, despite just winning about 50 percent of the vote.\\n\\nThe suit, brought by the League of Women Voters on behalf of 18 voters in each of the states congressional districts, said that GOP lawmakers had retaliated against Democratic voters for supporting Democratic candidates, violating the equal protection and free expression guarantees in the state constitution.\\n\\nThe justices gave GOP lawmakers until Feb. 9 to submit a new map and gave Gov. Tom Wolf (D) until Feb. 15 to approve it. Should the parties fail to reach an agreement on the plan, the justices said the court would move quickly on its own to develop a constitutional congressional map. The court said the new map could be expected by Feb. 19.\\n\\nPennsylvania voters will finally be able to cast their ballots in districts that were fairly and constitutionally drawn, David Gersch, one of the lawyers who argued the case on behalf of the plaintiffs, said in a call with reporters on Monday. This is a tremendous day for Pennsylvania, tremendous day for the voters and its also a tremendous step by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.The current map is the worst map in Pennsylvanias history.\\n\\nThe justices indicated the states congressional primary on May 15 would proceed as scheduled.\\n\\nThe court only issued an order on Monday and said a full opinion would follow. In a dissenting statement, the courts two Republicans, Chief Justice Thomas Saylor and Sallie Updyke Mundy, said they would not have issued a ruling until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on its partisan gerrymandering cases. They agreed with a lower courts finding, however, that the map raised substantial concerns about constitutional viability. In a separate dissenting opinion, Mundy expressed concern with the vagueness of the courts order, arguing it had instructed the legislature to redraw the states congressional map without giving it any guidance on how to do so.\\n\\nJustice Max Baer (D) wrote an opinion joining the majority in part and dissenting in part. He said he would have held off on redrawing the congressional map until 2020 so it didnt throw the states 2018 midterm elections into chaos and confusion.\\n\\nAt oral arguments in Harrisburg last week, lawyers for House Speaker Michael Turzai (R) and Senate President Tempore Joseph Scarnati (R) defended the map, saying that courts had never articulated a standard for when partisan gerrymandering was so egregious that it could be unconstitutional.\\n\\nE. Mark Braden, a lawyer for Turzai, said it was inconceivable that a political body like a legislature, which is constitutionally tasked with drawing lines for Congress, would not take partisan considerations into account.\\n\\nScarnati and Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman (R) criticized the Pennsylvania Supreme Courts decision on Monday, saying they intended to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to block the order to redraw the map.\\n\\nTodays ruling by the State Supreme Court is a partisan action showing a distinct lack of respect for the Constitution and the legislative process. The PA Supreme Court has overstepped its legal authority and set up an impossible deadline that will only introduce chaos in the upcoming Congressional election. The Court had this case since Nov. 9, 2017  giving it over 10 weeks to reach this decision, they said in a joint statement. Yet, it has elected to give the legislature 19 days to redraw and adopt the Congressional Districts. With matters the Supreme Court found unconstitutional in the past, it afforded the General Assembly four months to make corrections.\\n\\nThe statement continued, saying: It is clear that with this ruling the Court is attempting to bypass the Constitution and the legislative process and legislate themselves, directly from the bench.\\n\\nGov. Wolf, a named defendant in the suit who supported striking down the maps, said his administration was assessing next steps. Wolf would have to sign off on any maps passed by the legislature.\\n\\nI strongly believe that gerrymandering is wrong and consistently have stated that the current maps are unfair to Pennsylvanians. My administration is reviewing the order and we are assessing the executive branchs next steps in this process, he said in a statement.\\n\\nR. Stanton Jones, another lawyer for the plaintiffs, told reporters that any appeal would be unsuccessful because the challenge to the congressional map was only brought under the state constitution, not the federal one.\\n\\nIts well established that the United States Supreme Court does not review decisions of state court that exclusively construe state law, which is the exact situation you have here, Jones said. When people talk about federalism, the concept of federalism, this is an important part of it. The United States Supreme Court doesnt get to tell a states highest court what is state law, in this case Pennsylvania law.\\n\\nDemocrats praised the courts verdict.\\n\\nThis ruling is one more example of the courts telling Republican legislatures that drawing district lines for partisan purposes violates our democratic principles, said former Attorney General Eric Holder, now head of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, in a statement. What the Republican party has been doing diminishes the voting power of Americans and contributes to the polarization of our political system. This year, Pennsylvania voters can finally look forward to casting ballots under a fair and legal congressional map.   \n",

Tom Wolf has until Feb. 15 to approve it. If the deadlines arent met, the court will issue its own map.\\n\\nThe old congressional map, which was drafted by GOP lawmakers in 2011, will still be used for the special election in March for former Republican Rep. Tim Murphys old seat. He resigned last year after reports emerged he encouraged a woman who he was having an affair with to get an abortion.\\n\\nThe Court finds as a matter of law that the Congressional Redistricting Act of 2011 clearly, plainly and palpably violates the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and, on that sole basis, we hereby strike it as unconstitutional, the courts 4-3 order read.\\n\\nThe four justices throwing out the map were Democrats, while two of the dissenters are Republicans.\\n\\nThe order didnt give specific reasons for outlawing the 2011 map, but said a more detailed opinion would be forthcoming.\\n\\nDespite registered Democrats outnumbering Republican voters in the state, Republicans have consistently won 13 of the 18 districts.\\n\\nMondays ruling, though, could end up giving Democrats an edge during the midterms later this year.\\n\\nBut several of the states Republican lawmakers objected to the order, vowing to appeal to the nations Supreme Court this week.\\n\\nState Sens. Joe Scarnati and Jake Corman, both Republicans, issued a joint statement announcing their application for a stay of the Pennsylvania high courts decision, saying the justices took partisan actions.\\n\\nThe Court had this case since November 9, 2017  giving it over 10 weeks to reach this decision. Yet, it has elected to give the legislature 19 days to redraw and adopt the Congressional Districts, their statement read.\\n\\nWith matters the Supreme Court found unconstitutional in the past, it afforded the General Assembly four months to make corrections, they said.\\n\\nSteve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, tweeted that the state court will likely get the last word in this dispute, since the case deals with the state constitution, not federal.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court, though, did stay a North Carolina courts order last week, which had ordered the state of North Carolina to redraw its congressional map. The justices also heard a partisan gerrymandering case out of Wisconsin last year.\\n\\nA decision in the Wisconsin case is expected before the end of the term in June.\\n\\nMichael Li, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice which filed a friend of the court brief in the Pennsylvania case supporting the plaintiffs, said the ruling was a huge, historic win.\\n\\nWhile the U.S. Supreme Court will weigh in on the issue soon, the Pennsylvania decision shows that there is a second powerful avenue in state courts for voters fed up with gerrymandering, said Mr. Li.\\n\\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\\n\\nCopyright  2020 The Washington Times, LLC.

       "text_ascii     LONDON  Britain has voted to leave the European Union, a historic decision sure to reshape the nations place in the world, rattle the Continent and rock political establishments throughout the West.\\n\\nNot long after the vote tally was completed, Prime Minister David Cameron, who led the campaign to remain in the bloc, appeared in front of 10 Downing Street on Friday morning to announce that he planned to step down by October, saying the country deserved a leader committed to carrying out the will of the people.\\n\\nThe stunning turn of events was accompanied by a plunge in the financial markets, with the value of the British pound and stock prices plummeting.\\n\\nThe margin of victory startled even proponents of a British exit. The Leave campaign won by 52 percent to 48 percent. More than 17.4 million people voted in the referendum on Thursday to sever ties with the European Union, and about 16.1 million to remain in the bloc.\\n\\nI will do everything I can as prime minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months, Mr. Cameron said. But I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.\\n\\nDespite opinion polls before the referendum that showed either side in a position to win, the outcome stunned much of Britain, Europe and the trans-Atlantic alliance, highlighting the power of anti-elite, populist and nationalist sentiment at a time of economic and cultural dislocation.\\n\\nDare to dream that the dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom, Nigel Farage, the leader of the U.K. Independence Party, one of the primary forces behind the push for a referendum on leaving the European Union, told cheering supporters just after 4 a.m.\\n\\nWithdrawing from the European Union is a lengthy process that Mr. Cameron will largely leave to his successor. It will mean pulling out from the worlds largest trading zone, with 508 million residents, including the 65 million people of Britain, and a commitment to the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services. It has profound implications for Britains legal system, which incorporates a large body of regulations that cover everything from product safety to digital privacy, and for Britains economy.\\n\\nOne reason the City, Londons financial district, shuddered on Friday is that it is a hub for trading in euro-denominated securities, activity that may now shift to rivals like Frankfurt and Paris.\\n\\nIt was also not clear that the United Kingdom could survive withdrawal from the European Union intact. There was immediate pressure for another referendum on independence from Britain for Scotland, which voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to stay with Europe.\\n\\nI think an independence referendum is now highly likely, said Scotlands first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who said it would be democratically unacceptable for Scotland to be pushed out of the European Union when a majority of Scots want to stay in.\\n\\nKeith Vaz, a Labour legislator, said: This is a crushing decision; this is a terrible day for Britain and a terrible day for Europe. In 1,000 years, I would never have believed that the British people would vote for this.\\n\\nEuropean leaders acknowledged that the British vote would further limit their ability to move forward with economic and political integration, a process that had all but stalled anyway.\\n\\nToday marks a turning point for Europe, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said. It is a turning point for the European unification process.\\n\\nIn London, the maneuvering began almost immediately to succeed Mr. Cameron, who said he would stay on while his Conservative Party went through the process of settling on a new leader. Among the most prominent of the possible candidates is Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who was a leader of the Leave campaign. He praised Mr. Cameron as an extraordinary politician while saying he was sad to see him go.\\n\\nBritain will become the first country to leave the 28-member bloc, which has been increasingly weighed down by its failures to deal fully with a succession of crises, from the financial collapse of 2008 to a resurgent Russia and the huge influx of migrants last year.\\n\\nIt was a remarkable victory for the countrys anti-Europe forces, which not long ago were considered to have little chance of prevailing.\\n\\nFinancial markets, which had been anticipating that Britain would vote to stay in, started plunging before the vote tally was complete, putting pressure on central banks and regulators to take steps to guard against a spread of the damage.\\n\\nEconomists had predicted that a vote to leave the bloc could do substantial damage to the British economy. Mark Carney, the head of the Bank of England, sought to address those concerns on Friday, saying the bank had made extensive contingency plans and had taken all the necessary steps to prepare.\\n\\nMr. Cameron had vowed before the vote to move quickly to begin the divorce process if Britain opted to leave. But he said on Friday that he would leave the start of the formal process to his successor, while seeking in the interim to calm the atmosphere before taking any action.\\n\\nIn the meantime, nothing will change immediately on either side of the Channel, with existing trade and immigration rules remaining in place. The withdrawal process is expected to be complex and contentious, though under the blocs governing treaty it is effectively limited to two years.\\n\\nMr. Johnson, like a number of other leaders of the push to leave the European Union, said there was no need to rush to set in motion the legal procedure  invoking a provision known as Article 50  that would formally sever ties between Britain and the bloc. He and other advocates of leaving the European Union have been taking a go-slow posture on the mechanics of the divorce, saying Britain can get a better deal on trade if it can avoid arbitrary deadlines on the negotiations.\\n\\nFor the European Union, the result is a disaster, raising questions about the direction, cohesion and future of a bloc built on liberal values and shared sovereignty that represents, with NATO, a vital component of Europes postwar structure.\\n\\nBritain is the second-largest economy after Germany in the European Union, a nuclear power with a seat on the United Nations Security Council, an advocate of free-market economics and a close ally of the United States.\\n\\nThe loss of Britain is an enormous blow to the credibility of a bloc already under pressure from slow growth, high unemployment, the migrant crisis, Greeces debt woes and the conflict in Ukraine.\\n\\nThe main impact will be massive disorder in the E.U. system for the next two years, said Thierry de Montbrial, founder and executive chairman of the French Institute of International Relations. There will be huge political transition costs, on how to solve the British exit, and the risk of a domino effect or bank run from other countries that think of leaving.\\n\\nEurope will have to reorganize itself in a system of different degrees of association, said Karl Kaiser, a Harvard professor and former director of the German Council on Foreign Relations. Europe does have an interest in keeping Britain in the single market, if possible, and in an ad hoc security relationship.\\n\\nWhile leaders of the Leave campaign spoke earnestly about sovereignty and the supremacy of Parliament or in honeyed tones about the bright sunlit uplands of Britains future free of Brussels, it was anxiety about immigration that defined and probably swung the campaign.\\n\\nWith net migration to Britain of 330,000 people in 2015, more than half of them from the European Union, Mr. Cameron had no effective response to how he could limit the influx. And there was no question that while the immigrants contributed more to the economy and to tax receipts than they cost, parts of Britain felt that its national identity was under assault and that the influx was putting substantial pressure on schools, health care and housing.\\n\\nThe campaign run by one of the loudest proponents of leaving, the U.K. Independence Party, flirted with xenophobia, nativism and what some of its critics considered racism. But the official, more mainstream Leave campaign also invoked immigration as an issue, and its slogan, Take control, resonated with voters who feel that the government is failing to regulate the inflow of people from Europe and beyond.\\n\\nOther anti-establishment and far-right parties in Europe, like the National Front of Marine Le Pen in France, Geert Wilderss party in the Netherlands and the Alternative for Germany party will celebrate the outcome. The depth of anti-Europe sentiment could be a key factor in national elections scheduled next year in the other two most important countries of the European Union, France and Germany.\\n\\nThe British campaign featured assertions and allegations tossed around with little regard to the facts. Both sides played to emotion, and the most common emotion played upon was fear.\\n\\nThe Remain side, citing scores of experts and elite opinion, warned that leaving the bloc, a so-called Brexit, would mean an economic catastrophe, a plunging pound, higher taxes, more austerity and the loss of jobs.\\n\\nThe Leave side warned that remaining would produce uncontrolled immigration, crime and terrorism, with hordes pouring into Britain from Turkey, a country of 77 million Muslims that borders Syria and Iraq and hopes to join the European Union.\\n\\nJust a week before the vote, the country was jolted by the brutal murder of a young Labour member of Parliament, Jo Cox, 41, a strong supporter of Remain. A man who prosecutors said shouted Britain first, This is for Britain and Keep Britain independent was charged with her murder.\\n\\nIn England especially, 85 percent of the population of Britain, many people fell back on national pride, cultural exceptionalism and nostalgia. Many English voters chose to believe the insistence of anti-Europe leaders like Mr. Johnson that as a great nation, Britain would be more powerful and successful outside the European Union than inside.\\n\\nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland, by contrast, there was a strong pro-Europe feeling that has only increased tensions within the United Kingdom itself.\\n\\nNorthern Ireland, which has long had an open border with the Republic of Ireland, a member of the European Union, will face a new reality. That open border will become the border between the European Union and a nonmember, and for security and economic reasons it will have to be equipped with border posts to check goods and passports.\\n\\nMr. Cameron felt pushed into announcing the referendum in 2013 by the anti-Europe wing of his own party, amplified by concerns among other Tories that U.K. Independence Party and Mr. Farage were cutting too sharply into the Conservative vote.\\n\\nStill, Mr. Cameron entered the campaign with the force of economic experts, President Obama, European allies and big business behind him. But as ever, referendums are not about the question asked but the political mood at the time, and the political mood is sour.\n",
