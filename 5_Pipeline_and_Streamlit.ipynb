      "Tuesday afternoon, just before the courts order was released, Trump appealed for help in his boast that he had won, rather than lost, reelection.\n",

      "But Republican members of the legislature and Congress supported the challenge that the U.S. Supreme Court dispensed with Tuesday, which involved changes made to Pennsylvanias voting system in 2019 by the states GOP-controlled General Assembly.\n",

      "A group of Republican candidates led by U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly (Pa.) challenged Act 77, the law that established universal mail voting, claiming that the legislature had acted beyond its authority in approving it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said the challenge was filed too late  only after the votes were cast and the results known. Biden won the state by a more than 80,000-vote margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unanimous decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court blamed petitioners for a complete failure to act with due diligence in commencing their facial constitutional challenge, which was ascertainable upon Act 77s enactment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision noted, too, that some of the petitioners had urged their supporters to cast their ballots using the new mail-in procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court rarely intervenes in a decision of a state supreme court interpreting its own constitution and laws. But the plaintiffs asserted that the system raised federal issues. <span class=\"highlight-green\">Although acknowledging that it is up to states to develop election procedures, the claim was that the federal Constitution was violated if the Pennsylvania legislature expanded the mail-in procedure without proper authority from the state constitution.</span>\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, they claimed that the individual constitutional rights of Kelly and the others were violated. Their theory was that, as the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed the challenge because it was filed too late, they were denied due process.\n",
      "\n",
      "<span class=\"highlight-green\">Their suggested remedy was to invalidate all votes cast by mail in the general election  more than 2.5 million in total  or to dismiss the outcome of the election altogether so that the state legislature could appoint its own slate of presidential electors.</span>\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennsylvanias lawyers told the U.S. Supreme Court that that was a shocking request  nothing less than an affront to constitutional democracy that would ensnare the judiciary in partisan strife.\n",

      "\n",
      "Pennsylvanias lawyers said there was no conflict between the state constitution and Act 77, and that the specific requirements in the document were for absentee voting, not mail-in ballots. Their brief noted that the legislature had set a 180-day window for raising constitutional objections to the plan, which the challengers ignored.\n",

      "And it argued that the claims of a due-process violation were undercut by the relief Trump allies seek.\n",

      "\n",
      "Legal experts called the suit highly unusual and said it raises several questions, including whether Texas has standing to bring a retroactive complaint over how other states enforce their election statutes. The Constitution says it is up to individual states to set the terms for elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complaint filed by Paxton was a grab-bag of allegations about voting in the four states that have been largely rejected by individual courts. He sketched out a dark conspiracy to throw the election to Biden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a justification, government officials in the defendant states of Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania usurped their legislatures authority and unconstitutionally revised their states election statutes, the complaint states, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. They accomplished these statutory revisions through executive fiat or friendly lawsuits, thereby weakening ballot integrity. Finally, these same government officials flooded the . . . states with millions of ballots.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point, the complaint repeats discredited theories that Biden was rescued by a late dump of ballots, saying that as of 3 a.m. on the morning after the election, Bidens chances at winning all four states was less than one in a quadrillion.\n",
      "\n",
      "<span class=\"highlight-green\">The complaint asks the court to extend the deadline for the electoral colleges meeting, set for Dec. 14, and to disallow electors from the four states.</span> In a separate request for an injunction, it suggests an alternative: that the court vacate the states elector certifications from the unconstitutional 2020 election results and allow the state legislatures to appoint electors.\n",
      "\n",
      "<span class=\"highlight-green\">A constitutional provision allows states to sue one another at the Supreme Court without going through lower courts.</span> Usually, the subject matter is something such as water rights. In 2016, the court turned down an attempt by Nebraska and Oklahoma to object to Colorados liberalized laws on recreational marijuana use on the grounds that it was causing law enforcement or other problems in their own states.\n",

      "\n",
      "With all due respect, the Texas Attorney General is constitutionally, legally and factually wrong about Georgia, Katie Byrd, spokeswoman for the Georgia attorney generals office, said in a statement. Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr is a Republican.\n",

      "Attorneys general Nessel, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Josh Kaul of Wisconsin  all Democrats  issued a joint statement calling the effort an attempt to mislead the public and tear at the fabric of our Constitution.\n",

      "Its well past time for the president and our fellow states and elected officials to stop misleading the public about this years election and to acknowledge that the results certified in our states reflect the decisions made by the voters in a free, fair, and secure election, they stated.\n",

      "Stephen Vladeck, a constitutional law professor at the University of Texas, tweeted: It looks like we have a new leader in the craziest lawsuit filed to purportedly challenge the election category.\n",
      "\n",
      "<span class=\"highlight-green\">Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California at Irvine, called the filing a news release masquerading as a lawsuit in a blog post that outlined his view of why the action would not succeed.</span>\n",
      "\n",
      "While Tuesdays safe harbor deadline seemed to mark a turning point, Trumps legal team rejected that view.\n",
      "\n",
      "<span class=\"highlight-green\">The Safe Harbor Deadline is a statutory timeline that generally denotes the last day for states to certify election results, the Trump campaign said in statement attributed to lawyers Rudolph W. Giuliani and Jenna Ellis.</span> However, it is not unprecedented for election contests to last well beyond December 8.\n",

      "But Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) on Tuesday denounced Trumps efforts to overturn Bidens election win, calling the presidents actions completely unacceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toomey, who recently announced that he will not seek reelection in 2022, made the comments in an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The president should give up trying to get legislatures to overturn the results of the elections in their respective states, the senator told the newspaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toomey, who has congratulated Biden on his win, added that he spoke with the president-elect by phone last week and that the two had a very pleasant conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he also appeared to blame Democrats, in part, for many Republican voters refusal to accept the election results, arguing  without offering evidence  that those voters would be less likely to believe Trumps false claims if Democrats and the media had not sharply criticized the president over the past four years.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of Republicans across the commonwealth and across the country are sympathetic to some of the allegations being made by the president because theyve witnessed the way hes been treated for the last four years by the left and the press, Toomey said.\n"
