# Unbiased News

## Motivation  

We live in a world today that has become increasingly more divisive and vitriolic. People hold certain viewpoints and oft consider that view to be the complete & objective truth. But unfortunately, it is rarely so. 
Taking a step back, a huge driver for these divisive stands are news organizations that thrive on reporting with certain forms of bias built into their coverage. They would like to intentionally drive the narratives to their vested foregone conclusion.
If we the people, want to seek a wholesome understanding, it is expected that we read perhaps 10+ new sources to get to the source what’s actually happening in earnestness and what is being spewed as conjecture. As part of my passion project, I aim to use Data Science to make it easier for those who seek for an objective comprehension.

## Objective  

Using news articles written on the same topic by outlets who are on different ranges of political bias spectrum, I would like to create a model that can combine and summarize these articles to display what’s commonly being said and what is being mentioned solely be one side. 
Not only will this allow us to establish common ground on what is definitive, but also help us understand the narrative source for those who hold differing viewpoints.
Data Source: www.allsides.com (to start off with; will add more if time permits).

## Steps:
1. Combine & present what is commonly being said, using 2 articles – one from a left leaning organization and another from a right leaning organization.
1. Find ways to summarize the above, to make a more digestible read.
1. Identify ways to scope out more articles on the same topic (beyond the 2 used for ‘Step 1’) and include in the model for combining on common points & summarizing.
1. Extend functionality to be able to enter a news article link on an interactive interface, which can automatically seek out articles with opposing bias on the same topic & combine/summarize them.
1. Extend functionality to include viewpoints that have been completely omitted (or presented in an opposing manner) onto the combined article.
